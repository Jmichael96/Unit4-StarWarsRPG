# Unit4-StarWarsRPG

This project is a game that allows to choose your character, select an enemy of your choosing, and defeat every enemy thats left. Make sure you choose your enimies wisely!
As the game loads, images will appear with the character's name and health. Each player's health, attack power, and counter attack varies, but your character's power doubles over each attack. Once you chose your ally you will be prompted to choose your first enemy. They will appear in the 'battle area' and you may start clicking the attack button. If you defeated him you will chose the next oponent and repeat the process till all enemies are defeated.
